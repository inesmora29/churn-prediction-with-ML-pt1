# Project introduction 


Customer churn is a critical issue for businesses, especially in the subscription and financial sectors. Understanding why customers leave and predicting who is likely to churn enables proactive retention strategies. In this project, we use machine learning to predict customer churn based on behavior and demographic features. The dataset has been retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/churn-for-bank-customers/data

The purpose of this study is to support my training and development in machine learning by working through a complete, practical churn prediction project.

### Steps followed


* **Clean and Prepare Dataset**
  We will start by cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and preparing the data for analysis.

* **Data Exploration**
  We will explore how the variables relate to each other, examine the distribution of values, and visualize key patterns using plots and graphs.

* **Feature Engineering**
  We will create, transform, or modify features as needed to improve model performance.

* **Model Building**
  We will train several simple machine learning models to predict the target variable:

  * Logistic Regression
  * Random Forest
  * Decision Tree
  * Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

* **Hyperparameter Optimization**
  Using Randomized Grid Search, we will tune model parameters to improve performance.

* **Feature Selection**
  We will apply various techniques to identify and select the most relevant features for predicting the target variable.

* **Evaluate the Results**
  We will assess the performance of our models using appropriate evaluation metrics and compare their effectiveness.
